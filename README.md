Overview 
A very common use of computers is to run simulations. A simulation is a program designed to model a real system of interest. By setting parameters and selecting appropriate input values, results are produced that mimic the behavior of the real system. If the simulation is a valid representation of the real system, it can even predict the future performance of the real system. 
In this project, I created a program to simulate a grocery store. My goal was to use my simulation to answer to this specific question:

Should the owner of the store remodel her checkout lanes to include express self-checkout lanes and, if so, how many?
